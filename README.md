## Hi there üëã I am Enam Bansah, a passionate Front-End Developer with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flutter. 

## About Me
I hold a BSc in Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and my journey into programming began as a personal interest. As a self-taught developer, I‚Äôve immersed myself in the world of coding and constantly strive to improve my skills. In addition to web development, I have developed a keen interest in ethical hacking and am gaining hands-on experience using Linux for security and penetration testing.

When I‚Äôm not coding, you‚Äôll find me exploring new destinations, finding inspiration in nature, or learning new technologies. I‚Äôm always eager to take on new challenges, expand my knowledge, and grow my skill set. Feel free to check out my projects and reach out if you'd like to collaborate or connect!
