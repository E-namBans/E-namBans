## Hi there 👋 I am Enam Bansah, a passionate Front-End Developer with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and Flutter. 

## About Me
I specialize in creating responsive, accessible, and pixel-perfect web experiences. I am always eager to explore new technologies and learn new skills. Currently, I'm expanding my expertise by learning Python and Flutter to build mobile applications alongside web development.

When I'm not coding, I love exploring new destinations and finding inspiration in nature. Feel free to explore my work and get in touch!

CSS: Styling the website, including flexbox, grid layout, and media queries for responsiveness.
JavaScript: Adding interactive elements such as dark mode toggle.
Python: Future backend development (not yet implemented in this portfolio).
Flutter: For building mobile applications (learning in progress).
